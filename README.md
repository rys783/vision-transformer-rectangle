# README.md

This repo extends Phil Wang's <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch">Vision Transformer PyTorch implementation</a> to rectangel patches and input images, as well as the hybrid architecture which projects the intermediate feature maps of a CNN model to the input sequence of the transformer.
